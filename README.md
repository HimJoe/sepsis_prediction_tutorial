# Multi-modal Deep Learning for Early Sepsis Prediction

This repository contains a self-learning tutorial on building a multi-modal deep learning system for early sepsis prediction. The approach combines structured clinical data (vital signs, lab values) with unstructured text data (clinical notes) through a cross-modal attention mechanism.

## Project Overview

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection damages its own tissues and organs. Early detection is critical - each hour of delay in appropriate antibiotic treatment increases mortality by approximately 8%. This tutorial demonstrates how multi-modal deep learning can predict sepsis 6-12 hours before clinical manifestation.

### Key Features

- Multi-modal architecture combining structured data and text embeddings
- Cross-modal attention mechanism for feature interaction
- Interpretable predictions using SHAP values
- Thorough evaluation and deployment considerations
